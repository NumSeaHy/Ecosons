"""
Interpolates a set of 2D or 3D line segments into evenly spaced points.

# Arguments
- `xyzs`: An `NxD` matrix of coordinates, where each row represents a point in 2D or 3D space (typically `D = 2` or `3`).
- `shns`: A vector of shape/group identifiers (`N` elements), grouping the rows of `xyzs` into distinct shapes.
- `dl`: Desired spacing between interpolated points.

# Returns
- A matrix of interpolated points (`MxD`), where `M â‰¥ N`. All input shapes are processed independently, and points are interpolated along each segment at approximately uniform spacing `dl`.

# Notes
- Segments within a shape are interpolated linearly.
- NaNs in `xyzs` are treated as breakpoints and skipped.
- The first point of each shape is always preserved.
